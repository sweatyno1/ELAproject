        <h2>Hi, the following is addressed to the many people interested in Eco-light:</h2>
        <h4>What are we doing?</h4>
        <p class="space">-  What if you were walking down the sidewalk, and you saw the beautiful illuminating of the tree, the light glows in your face? This is our dream, at Eco-light we want to make a nature-friendly light source, not just for streetlights, but also for the inside of homes. A study posted on epa.gov, asks the question about how much CO2 electricity production costs. After analysis of many homes across the country, the website says this, “each home emits 10.97 metric tons of CO2 per year…” If we replace the lights in this home, we could save the atmosphere. But more than one source supports this, furthermore, on our problem, the website DarkSky supports our specific problem it says, “15 million tons of Carbon Dioxide Emitted Each Year On Residential Outdoor Lighting in the U.S.” The creation of a new invention that protects the environment inside and outside will be revolutionary.</p>

        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p class="space">- Eco-light is a startup company, and we are working on creating our bioluminescent plants with "light capacitors", which is what the MIT study (linked on the Home page) used. Evidence from the study suggests that it is possible to insert these capacitors through the stomata to create a plant that produces light. Though the resources MIT originally used in 2017 could only get a plant to glow dimly, they later changed the idea to light capacitors and got it to glow 10x brighter.</p>
        <p class="space">- After some research, I found in around 2013 a startup called TAXA Biotechnologies raised $484,000 (way past their goal of $65,000) to create a glowing plant using DNA splicing. The startup failed and was a disaster, but 4 years later in 2017, this MIT study was released and had extremely positive results. They released the results and ended it there, or did it. 4 more years later, in 2021, MIT released another study, “The next generation of glowing plants”. The original problem was it couldn’t produce enough light in 2017, but they made it 10 times brighter, how? They used something called a “light capacitator” which catches the photons and later in the dark, releases them. </p>
        <p class="space">- to create their “light capacitor,” the researchers decided to use a type of material known as a phosphor. These materials can absorb either visible or ultraviolet light and then slowly release it as a phosphorescent glow. The researchers used a compound called strontium aluminate, which can be formed into nanoparticles, as their phosphor. Before embedding them in plants, the researchers coated the particles in silica, which protects the plant from damage.</p>
